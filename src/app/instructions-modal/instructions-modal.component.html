  <h2>welcome 🤗</h2>
  <p>
  degreezle asks only one thing of you: connect the first film to the last. 
  every puzzle has a solution of six or less steps but be our guest and take as long as you want. 
  build a solution by connecting film to cast&crew to their filmographies &tc &tc.

  e.g.:
  <img class="example-solution" src="assets/examplesolution.png">
  </p>
  <p>
  all data is from TMDB and is cached each day when retrieved. 
  so updating TMDB today probably won’t help you connect (today_start) to (today_end) 
  but it will help next time you need that connection to solve the degreezle. 
  we wholeheartedly encourage you to improve the data quality of TMDB! 🙏
