  <p>hi! ðŸ‘‹ </p>

  <p><strong>filminthega.ps</strong> has been running for almost a year <span *ngIf="numberOfPuzzlesSolved">and you've completed {{numberOfPuzzlesSolved}} puzzles</span>.</p>

  <p>if everyone who regularly plays donated $5 via <a href="https://ko-fi.com/filminthegaps">our ko-fi page</a> it would cover our annual domain renewal. we will renew the domain if we gather $200 by July 14, otherwise filminthega.ps will be no more!</p>

  <p>if <a href="filminthega.ps">filminthega.ps</a> lives to celebrate its first birthday, donors will get to guest-write a puzzle and, among other improvements, we will build an archive so you can easily find and complete any puzzles you've missed.</p>

  <p>thanks!</p>
  <p>andrew & joÃ£o</p>
